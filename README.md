Steinbrenner Oracle for iOS
===========================

This is the iOS app for Steinbrenner High School's newspaper, the Oracle. It is no longer in the store as I had no time to maintain it and have graduated from high school.

Be warned that this is raw code. Most of the code is from the original prototype, tweaked to be slightly more efficient. Tagged releases starting with 1.0.0 were submitted to Apple; 1.1.0 was the first public release.
