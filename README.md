Steinbrenner Oracle for iOS
===========================

#### Get it in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/steinbrenner-oracle/id766151741?ls=1&mt=8)

This is the iOS app for Steinbrenner High School's newspaper, the Oracle.

Be warned that this is raw code. Most of the code is from the original prototype, tweaked to be slightly more efficient. Tagged releases starting with 1.0.0 were submitted to Apple; 1.1.0 was the first public release. The code works but is due for a rewrite, which will likely happen over the summer of 2014.

The app is in the App Store under the name Micheal Oldenburg because I am a minor with no credit card in my name.
